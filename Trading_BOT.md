Building an End-to-End AI Trading Bot for Short-Term Trading
Since you're experienced in Python, GCP, Bash, and SQL, we'll leverage GCP for cloud deployment, Python for AI modeling, and brokerage APIs for trade execution.

1. System Architecture

An AI trading bot consists of the following components:

(a) Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
Live Market Data: Fetch stock prices from APIs like Alpaca, IEX Cloud, or Yahoo Finance.
News & Sentiment Data: Use NLP on financial news (FinBERT, OpenAI API).
Data Storage: Store price data in BigQuery for analysis.
(b) AI Model for Trade Signal Generation
Supervised ML (XGBoost, LSTMs): Predict short-term price movement.
Reinforcement Learning (DQN, PPO): Train an agent to learn optimal buy/sell strategies.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze Twitter, Reddit for trading signals.
(c) Trade Execution & Risk Management
Brokerage API Integration: Execute trades via Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, or TD Ameritrade.
Risk Controls: Implement stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing.
(d) Backtesting & Performance Evaluation
Backtest Strategies: Simulate trading on historical data using Backtrader or Zipline.
Evaluate KPIs: Sharpe Ratio, Win Rate, Max Drawdown.
(e) Deployment & Automation
Cloud Deployment: Host AI models on GCP Vertex AI.
Serverless Execution: Use Cloud Functions or Kubernetes.
Monitoring Dashboard: Build a Streamlit or Dash web app for monitoring.
2. Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Data Collection & Storage
✅ Set up a pipeline to collect real-time stock price data.
✅ Store it in BigQuery and preprocess it with Pandas/Numpy.

Phase 2: AI Model Development
✅ Train a model (XGBoost, LSTM, RL) to generate buy/sell signals.
✅ Tune hyperparameters & evaluate performance.

Phase 3: Trading Bot Development
✅ Integrate with Alpaca API for automated trade execution.
✅ Implement risk management strategies.

Phase 4: Backtesting & Optimization
✅ Use Backtrader/Zipline to simulate trades on past data.
✅ Optimize strategy with Sharpe ratio & profit factor.

Phase 5: Deployment & Automation
✅ Deploy the model on GCP Vertex AI.
✅ Set up a Streamlit dashboard to track performance.
✅ Automate trade execution with Cloud Functions.
